# Advent of code

My attempt at solving the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
2021 was the first year I actually went for it, and I am hooked.

I think I will try to solve these problems in multiple languages.
Starting with Python.

# Usage

- go to the project root
- create a virtualenv (one time only)

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

- activate it (every new session)

```shell
source "./venv/bin/activate"
```

# ivonet package

Contains many of the convenience methods / classes and functions I created while
solving these puzzles and use in the puzzles.

Just run the `enable_ivonet_package.sh` script from the root if this project in
a terminal.

it will:

- create e file called `ivonet.pth`in the virtual env `site-packages` folder.
- in that pth file it will place the location if this project root and that is
  it.
- now the ivonet package is accessible from all the years when running in the
  virtual environment.
