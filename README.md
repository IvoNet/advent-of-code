# Advent of code

My attempt at solving the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
2021 was the first year I actually went for it, and I am hooked.

I think I will try to solve these problems in multiple languages.
Starting with Python.

# Usage

- go to the project root
- create a virtualenv (one time only)

```shell
python3.9 -m venv venv
```

- activate it (every new session)

```shell
source "./venv/bin/activate"
```

# ivonet package

To use the ivonet package please create e file called `ivonet.pth`
in the virtual env `site-packages` folder e.g.
in `PROJECT_DIR_HERE/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ivonet.pth`
in that file put one string with the exact (fully qualified) path to the ivonet
package parent folder in the project (root of project). e.g.
`/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/dev/advent-of-code/`
do not include the package name itself just the path to the folder where it
lives

now the ivonet package is accessible from all the years when running in the
virtual environment.
